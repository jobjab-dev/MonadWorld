            <p className="docs-paragraph">The website you are using! Built with modern web technologies (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) to provide a smooth, pixel-perfect experience for minting, collecting, and interacting with your Lilnad NFTs.</p>

            <p className="docs-paragraph">New Lilnad NFTs are minted using a secure Commit-Reveal process. This ensures fairness in rank assignment, making it exciting to see what rank your new Lilnad will be! If you don\'t complete the reveal process in time, your NFT will still be minted but will receive the lowest rank.</p>
            <p className="docs-sub-paragraph">Available packs (subject to change on Testnet): Single Mint, Pack 10 (+1 Bonus), Pack 25 (+3 Bonus).</p>

            <p className="docs-paragraph">Your Lilnad NFTs are Soul-Bound Tokens. They accrue scores over time based on their rank â€“ the higher the rank, the faster the score accrual! </p>
            <p className="docs-sub-paragraph">Make sure to `collect()` your scores periodically. Each NFT has a defined lifecycle and will eventually stop accruing scores (become "dead").</p>

            <p className="docs-paragraph">MonadWorld features an exciting seasonal reward system!</p>
            <ul className="docs-list">
              <li>**Snapshots:** Player scores are recorded every 7 days.</li>
              <li>**Reward Pool & LOVE Generation:** All MON collected from LilnadNFT minting fees (after a 5% development fee) is designated for the seasonal rewards. For every 1 MON allocated to a season, 2 LOVE tokens are minted by the `LoveDistributor` contract.</li>
              <li>**Liquidity Provision (LP):** The entirety of the seasonal MON (from the reward pool) along with an equivalent amount of the newly minted LOVE (i.e., 1 MON : 1 LOVE ratio from the minted total) are used to provide liquidity for the MON/LOVE trading pair on a Decentralized Exchange. This creates a foundational market for LOVE tokens.</li>
              <li>**Player Rewards:** The remaining LOVE tokens (the other half of the total minted LOVE after LP provision) are then distributed to the top 70% of players based on their collected scores during that season.</li>
              <li>**Lottery-Style Distribution:** Your collected score acts like lottery tickets (1 score = 1 ticket). While you can only win one prize tier per season, having more tickets significantly increases your chances of winning a higher-tier prize! The exact prize structure is determined off-chain for each season.</li>
